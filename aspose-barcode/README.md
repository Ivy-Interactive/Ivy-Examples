## Created Using Ivy

Web application created using [Ivy-Framework](https://github.com/Ivy-Interactive/Ivy-Framework).

**Ivy** - The ultimate framework for building internal tools with LLM code generation by unifying front-end and back-end into a single C# codebase. With Ivy, you can build robust internal tools and dashboards using C# and AI assistance based on your existing database.

Ivy is a web framework for building interactive web applications using C# and .NET.

## Interactive Example For Barcode Generation

This example showcases generating multiple barcode symbologies (QR, PDF417, Code128, DataMatrix, DotCode, ISBN) with adjustable sizes and instant preview.

**What This Application Does:**

- **Generate Barcodes**: Create barcodes from input text across popular symbologies
- **Adjust Size**: Choose from Small, Medium, Large presets (tuned X-Dimension)
- **Live Preview**: See a crisp, non-scaled preview
- **Download PNG**: One-click download of the generated barcode image

**Technical Implementation:**

- Uses Aspose.BarCode `BarcodeGenerator` with `SymbologyEncodeType`
- Sets `Parameters.Barcode.XDimension.Pixels` based on size presets for sharp output
- Generates Base64 PNG for the in-app preview and byte stream for download
- Single C# view (`Apps/BarcodeApp.cs`) built with Ivy UI primitives
