## Created Using Ivy

Web application created using [Ivy-Framework](https://github.com/Ivy-Interactive/Ivy-Framework).

**Ivy** - The ultimate framework for building internal tools with LLM code generation by unifying front-end and back-end into a single C# codebase. With Ivy, you can build robust internal tools and dashboards using C# and AI assistance based on your existing database.

Ivy is a web framework for building interactive web applications using C# and .NET.

## Interactive Example For OCR (Image To Text)

This example showcases extracting text from images using Aspose.OCR with a simple two-panel UI: upload on the left, recognized text on the right.

**What This Application Does:**

- **Upload Image**: Select an image file and run OCR
- **Text Extraction**: Recognize text from the uploaded image
- **Monospaced Viewer**: See output in a clean, plain-text viewer
- **Validation**: Basic size check with friendly error messages

**Technical Implementation:**

- Uses Aspose.OCR `AsposeOcr` with `OcrInput(InputType.SingleImage)`
- Adds uploaded image stream via `source.Add(stream)` and calls `Recognize`
- Shows the first `RecognitionResult.RecognitionText` in a `CodeInput`
- Single C# view (`Apps/ImageToTextApp.cs`) built with Ivy UI primitives

## How to Run

   ```
4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet watch
   ```
5. **Open your browser** to the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5010`)

## How to Deploy

Deploy this example to Ivy's hosting platform:

1. **Navigate to the example**:
   ```bash
   cd aspose-ocr
   ```
2. **Deploy to Ivy hosting**:
   ```bash
   ivy deploy
   ```
This will deploy your OCR application with a single command.
